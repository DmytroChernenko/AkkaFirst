Statement of work for AW Group
File contains 100 000 strings like "id;amount". There are only 1000 unique ids.
Our task is to parse this file and to summ amount for every id. Result we should write in other file.

I had made two solutions for this task. First is simple one-thread java programm. Second is solution with Akka toolkit. 

All works fine and result is given in result.txt and result2.txt(for Akka).
